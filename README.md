## What is Requirement Analysis?  
**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, documenting, and validating the needs and constraints of stakeholders to define the functional and non-functional requirements of a software system. It bridges the gap between business objectives and technical implementation, ensuring the final product aligns with user expectations.

### Key Activities  
1. **Elicitation**: Gathering requirements through interviews, surveys, workshops, or user stories.  
2. **Documentation**: Creating clear specifications (e.g., **SRS** or user stories).  
3. **Validation**: Checking for completeness, consistency, and feasibility.  
4. **Prioritization**: Ranking requirements based on business value and technical constraints.  

### Importance in SDLC  
✔ **Reduces risks** by catching ambiguities early  
✔ **Guides design/development** with a clear blueprint  
✔ **Aligns stakeholders** (clients, teams, users)  
✔ **Enables accurate testing** with well-defined criteria  

> Without proper analysis, projects risk scope creep, delays, or product failures.
